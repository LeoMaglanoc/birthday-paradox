# birthday-paradox
 
This was a project for the course "Computer Architecture" during Summer Semester 2020 in a group of 3 people. A general form of the "birthday-paradox-formula" had to be implemented efficiently in x86-64 Assembly and C. Two different approaches were followed: one with a taylor ansatz and one with a lookup-table which I implemented.
